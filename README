    # Game is fully playable less an obvious you win function

#TODO:
General refactor to clean things up since this wasn't initially meant to be a full featured app.

Working on implementing some re-usable controls for the UI, that may be the start point
    for a controls lib on top of the SFML Rust bindings. Buttons, Menu, Gameboard.

Cooler graphics and color scheme.
